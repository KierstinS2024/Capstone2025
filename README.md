# Capstone2025
First Springboard Capstone Project ideas:





1. **Mandarin Chinese Language Learning App**(MOST INTERESTED)
Problem: Learning Mandarin Chinese is particularly difficult due to its tonal nature, unique characters, and complex grammar rules. Many learners struggle with pronunciation, remembering vocabulary, and understanding sentence structure. There is a lack of comprehensive, interactive platforms that integrate all aspects of language learning—speaking, listening, reading, and writing—into a unified experience.

Solution: The app will provide a holistic language learning experience by focusing on vocabulary, pronunciation, grammar, and character recognition. The app will integrate spaced repetition for vocabulary retention, audio clips for pronunciation practice, quizzes for grammar reinforcement, and tools to help users recognize and understand Chinese characters. A personalized learning path will help users track their progress and improve at their own pace.

Potential APIs:

Google Cloud Speech API: To provide real-time pronunciation feedback by recognizing the user’s voice and comparing it to native Mandarin pronunciation.
MDBG or CC-CEDICT API: To access Mandarin word definitions, example sentences, and translations.
Mandarin Chinese Audio API (like FluentU): For native speaker audio clips that users can listen to and mimic for pronunciation practice.
Chinese Character Recognition API (like OCR or Google Vision): To help users recognize characters by providing real-time identification and explanations when they scan or input Chinese characters.


2. **Outdoorsy App (Similar to AllTrails)**
Problem: Outdoor enthusiasts often find it difficult to locate suitable trails based on their preferences, such as difficulty level, activity type (hiking, biking, etc.), and geographic location. Furthermore, many existing resources don’t provide enough user-generated content or real-time updates on trail conditions, leaving outdoor adventurers with incomplete or unreliable information.

Solution: The app will offer a comprehensive platform for discovering and reviewing outdoor trails, including maps, user reviews, ratings, and photos. It will provide users with trail difficulty levels, location-based searches, and suggestions based on personal preferences. Community-driven content (like photos, reviews, and updates) will ensure the app remains current and relevant. Users can save trails, share experiences, and track their outdoor activity history.

Potential APIs:

Google Maps API: To provide mapping features, location tracking, and geospatial data for trails.
Trail API (like Open Trails API or Mapbox): For detailed trail data, including trail length, difficulty, and geographic information.
Weather API (like OpenWeather or AccuWeather): To provide weather forecasts and real-time conditions for trails.
Strava API: To allow users to log their outdoor activities (e.g., hikes or bike rides) and share them with the app’s community.


3. **Recipe & Meal Planner App**
Problem: Meal planning can be time-consuming, especially for individuals with dietary restrictions, time constraints, or limited knowledge of healthy food options. People often struggle to find recipes that fit their specific nutritional goals and end up wasting time on grocery shopping or meal prep.

Solution: This app will offer personalized meal planning and recipe recommendations based on the user’s preferences, dietary restrictions, and nutritional goals. It will allow users to save and organize recipes, create shopping lists, and plan meals for the week. Users can input their available ingredients to get recipe suggestions, and the app will provide nutritional information for each meal. It will also allow users to track their food intake and ensure they meet their dietary goals.

Potential APIs:

Spoonacular API: For recipe suggestions, nutritional information, and ingredient data.
Edamam API: For nutritional analysis and food database access.
Open Food Facts API: To get detailed data on food products and ingredients, especially for barcode scanning.
TheMealDB API: For a database of meal recipes with categories, ingredient lists, and meal photos.
