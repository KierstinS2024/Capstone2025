# Capstone Project Proposal: Recipe & Meal Planner App (Using Vite)

## 1. Tech Stack

For this project, I will utilize the **MERN** (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) tech stack (that we have been learning), enhanced with **Vite** for a faster and more efficient frontend development experience. Specifically:

- **Frontend**: **React.js** with **Vite** will be used to build a dynamic and interactive user interface for the app. Vite will replace traditional bundlers like Webpack, providing faster development builds and optimized production bundling.
- **Backend**: **Node.js** with **Express** will handle API requests, manage backend logic, and interact with the MongoDB database.
- **Database**: **MongoDB** will store user data, recipes, meal plans, shopping lists, and other relevant data.
- **Authentication**: **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** and **Passport.js** will be used for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **APIs**: I plan to incorporate external APIs like **Spoonacular** or **Edamam** for recipe suggestions, nutritional analysis, and product data.

## 2. Focus

This will be an evenly focused full-stack application, with both the frontend and backend working seamlessly to deliver a complete meal planning solution. **Vite** will significantly improve the frontend experience by ensuring faster build times, hot module reloading (HMR), and optimized production builds, allowing for more efficient development and smooth deployment.

- **Frontend**: The main UI will feature various user inputs for meal planning, recipe display, and interaction with external APIs. Vite will ensure fast and reliable frontend development, with easy integration to React components, API calls, and smooth state management.
- **Backend**: Node.js with Express will manage user authentication, interact with the database, and integrate with external APIs for recipes and nutritional data. The backend will expose endpoints to handle all interactions with the frontend.

## 3. Platform

The app will be developed as a **web app** using **React** with **Vite**. The app will be optimized for desktop and mobile browsers, ensuring a smooth experience across all screen sizes. 

## 4. Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to create an app that helps users plan their meals effectively while considering their dietary restrictions, preferences, and nutritional goals.

Key features will include:
- Personalized recipe recommendations based on dietary restrictions (e.g., vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
- Meal planning with customizable weekly plans and time-saving features
- Shopping list generation that maps out ingredients and quantities
- Nutritional tracking and analysis, helping users monitor caloric intake and macronutrients
- Ingredient-based recipe suggestions, helping users cook based on what’s available in their pantry
- User account management (sign-up, login, profile management, and picture upload)

## 5. Target Users

The target demographic for this app includes:
- **Health-conscious individuals** looking for meal prep ideas and nutritional tracking
- **People with dietary restrictions** (e.g., gluten-free, vegan, low-carb, or keto)
- **Busy professionals or parents** who need a convenient meal planning and shopping solution
- **Fitness enthusiasts** who want to track macronutrients and calories effectively
- **Anyone looking to save time** on grocery shopping and meal prep, while maintaining nutritional balance

## 6. Data Collection and APIs

External APIs will be integrated for recipe suggestions, nutritional analysis, and product information. These include:
- **Spoonacular API** or **Edamam API** for recipe suggestions, ingredients, nutritional data, and analysis.
- **Open Food Facts API** for product barcodes, ingredient details, and nutritional data for products.

User data will include account information (sign-up, profile), preferences (dietary needs), meal plans, shopping lists, and tracked food intake.
